# Titanic-Survival-Prediction-
ML_ Development project
# Machine Learning Streamlit App

##  Overview
This project is an interactive **Machine Learning Web App** built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/).  
It enables users to **upload datasets, preprocess data, train models, visualize results, and make predictions** directly from a browser interface.

## Features
- Data Upload & Preprocessing – Upload CSV files, clean and prepare data for modeling.
- Model Training – Train various ML models using [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/).
- Interactive Visualizations – Explore data with interactive charts (Plotly, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
- Real-time Predictions – Make predictions using trained models without reloading.
- Model Persistence – Save and load models with Joblib.
